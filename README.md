# ml-hackathon


Under demo there is a little example I hacked up just to show how to get raw images, prepare them and plot the result.

This is just to be used as reference as models should indeed be stored, deployed, wrapped into daemons/containers and connected to Erlang via port/distribution.

Figure_1 shows the result which is far from accurate.

In order to make it more accurate, there could be more preparation on the images, a higher definition and more data.

In particular some images came up with "photo is no longer available" and therefore should be removed from the training and test set.
